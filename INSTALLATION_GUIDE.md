## First-time Setup

1. When you first launch the application, you'll need to:
   - Select an input directory containing your PDF bank statements
   - Choose an output directory for extracted CSV files
   - Select your bank type (currently supports Chase and Bank of America)

2. Click "Process Statements" to extract transaction data from your PDFs

3. Use "Merge All CSV Files" to combine multiple statements into one report

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Application won't start**:
   - Windows: Make sure Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is installed
   - macOS: Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper
   - Linux: Make sure the AppImage has execute permissions

2. **PDF extraction fails**:
   - Ensure your PDF files are not password protected
   - Check that the statements are from supported banks
   - Verify the PDF format matches expected layouts

3. **Dependencies issues**:
   - If using the Python package method, ensure all required packages are installed:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
